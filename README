================
Running trexbot
================

trexbot requires the python-zephyr module, found at:
http://github.com/ebroder/python-zephyr

Make sure you have tickets, and then run 'python t-rex.py'

===============
Configuration
===============
Most useful configuration options are listed at the top of the python file.
The most important ones to touch are the zsender and the zclass, which
indicate to what class and as whom the bot will zephyr.

The special_messages dictionary is useful to allow your bot to respond in
a special manner when keywords are sent.  The key is the keyword, and the 
value is the sent message.
