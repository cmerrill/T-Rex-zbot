================
Running trexbot
================
trexbot requires the python-zephyr module, which is included in this
branch (include-i386-zephyr).  If you are not on the correct platform or 
get errors when importing, you should install the python-zephyr module 
found at http://github.com/ebroder/python-zephyr.

Make sure you have tickets, and then run 'python t_rex.py'

===============
Configuration
===============
Configuration options are stored in zbot_config.py

The most important ones to touch are the zsender and the zclass, which
indicate to what class and as whom the bot will zephyr.

The special_messages dictionary is useful to allow your bot to respond in
a special manner when keywords are sent.  The key is the keyword, and the 
value is the sent message.

The hello_components list is where the parts of the random hello messages
are selected from.

Other options control the frequency of messages and the variance around
that frequency.
